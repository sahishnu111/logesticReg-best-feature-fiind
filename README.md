The main goal is to help a farmer decide which crop to plant based on the soil's characteristics. We have a dataset with soil measurements (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, and pH) and the recommended crop for those measurements. Our task is to use machine learning to find out which of these single soil measurements is the best at predicting the right crop.

Think of it like being a detective. We have four clues (N, P, K, pH) and we want to know which single clue gives us the strongest hint about the mystery (which crop to plant).
